### The net ninja Vue 3 YT: 20.12.1

* JS/TS framework - after doing the react tut, vue seems very similar regarding routing, SPA,  etc.
* create SPA (single page app) or widgets
    * handles routing in the browser not the server
    * only a single HTML page is sent to browser with the vue package
    * i.e. a link is handled in vue JS bundle
* Unlike react, you can have multiple root components (parents)
* render content from one component anywhere in the DOM
* vscode Vue syntax highlight extention: Vetur
* will use the vue.js CDN first -- see v3.vuejs.org
* created app.js -- vue code will go here
* tut4 - Vue CLI for full Vue apps
    * install - must have node installed (npm), istall globally: `npm install -g @vue/cli`

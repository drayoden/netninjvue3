### The net ninja Vue 3 (20.12.1)

* JS/TS framework - after doing the react tut, vue seems very similar regarding routing, etc.
* create SPA (single page app) or widgets
    * handles routing in the browser not the server
    * only a single HTML page is sent to browser with the vue package
    * i.e. a link is handled in vue not the server
